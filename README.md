Consenz is a platform for creating agreements.
The platform lets a group of people create a document that reflects the issues they agree upon
and discuss the issues that are in disagreement.

The platform allows any group of people at any scale to formulate a text
in a single, coherent and clear document in a transparent and democratic way.
The platform enable it through a new kind of Internet discussion.
Instead of spreading across countless responses,
the discussion converges around a collaborative and democratic document
by incorporating voting mechanisms with discussion tools.
This allows to distinguish between agreed upon and controversial issues,
and the process has a clear product: A text that reflects the consent of the participants.

The consensus meter is an algorithm that determine the document Threshold: 
A number that represent how many supporters needed to approve an edit suggestion to the document.
The threshold is always a percentage of the total sum of users in a document at given time.
